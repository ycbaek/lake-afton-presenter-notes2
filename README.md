# Lake Afton Public Observatory Presenter Notes
This project uses [MKDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) to create web pages providing notes of the objects and programs used at the telescope during the public programs.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [Build and Deployment](#build-and-deployment) below for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

See the pip-dependencies.txt file for the Python package requirements for the LAPO Presenter Notes:

## Project Setup
The following are the steps I used to create the fresh Presenter Notes project, 
and these notes can be used for creating a fresh, brand-new MkDocs project.
However, if you are just cloning the existing Presenter Notes project from GitHub, then you can skip these steps and go directly to [Clone this Project](#clone-this-project)
    
### Install Python - the Presenter Notes are using version 3.6.1: [www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
	
### Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment for the Presenter Notes Project.  
Begin by creating a directory for the Python virtual environment;
I am using d:\gitLAPO\lake-afton-presenter-notes\ for the local project repository:

```
md d:\gitLAPO
cd d:\gitLAPO
virtualenv lake-afton-presenter-notes
```

#### Activate the virtual environment:

```
cd lake-afton-presenter-notes
Scripts\activate.bat
```
		
### Install Python Packages

**Short-cut**: to install *ALL* pip dependencies:

```python
pip install -r pip-dependencies.txt
```

... or for manual installation ... do the following...

... from the d:\gitLAPO\lake-afton-presenter-notes\ folder, PIP install MKDocs:

```python
pip install mkdocs
```
reference [MKDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) for more information 

Theme -- [Cyborg](http://mkdocs.github.io/mkdocs-bootswatch/#cyborg) is a part of the mkdocs-bootswatch package:

```python
pip install mkdocs-bootswatch
```

Additional customization of the theme is found in \lake-afton-presenter-notes\docs\css\nightvision.css

### Start MkDocs Server
To start the MKDocs dev server for testing.
From the presenterNotes folder, execute the following command

	mkdocs serve

You can then open the local site for testing:<br>
	http://127.0.0.1:8000/
	
## Clone this Project

From the GitHub repository: https://github.com/caketron/lake-afton-presenter-notes
select Clone and copy the URL to the repo: https://github.com/caketron/lake-afton-presenter-notes.git

Then from your local project folder (I am using d:\gitLAPO), execute the following git command:
```git
git clone https://github.com/caketron/lake-afton-presenter-notes
```

## Build and Deployment
Once all editing has been completed, do a final build of the document site for deployment

```
mkdocs build
```

TO DO:  ... to be completed ... !!!
	
## Remaining Tasks:
1. Readthedocs.org provides free hosting for MkDocs - need to set up a site and configured to auto-build upon any code changes in the linked GitHub project.
    So as changes are made to the lapoPresenterNotes, they automatically build and deploy to the readthedocs.org site.
		
1. Also, could add a CNAME to the lakeafton.org domain host to point to the readthedocs.org siteâ€¦ suggest docs.lakeafton.org or notes.lakeafton.org

1. For Consideration: Readthedocs.org is going to start showing Ads on the free hosting... so may want to consider moving to a self-hosted site (where the LAPO web site lives?) -- or perhaps making use of Git Pages for hosting (this may require some restructuring of the pages.)

## Versioning
For the sake of tracking version history, the version numbering will follow a year, month, date numbering sequence, following by a sequence id to account for multiple versions within a single date, in the following format:

	yyyy.MM.dd.#
	e.g.,...  2017.05.02.0

Use this versioning strategy when applying label to the source.

## Contributing
Please follow these simple rules when contributing additional content or changes to the notes:

1. Add a note referencing the source of the material that is being added or changed.
