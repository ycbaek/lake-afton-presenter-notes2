|Actual Brightness|2002-09-25|previous: 0.5 (sun)  – BUT new info from SEDS|
|Magnitude Central Star|2002-09-25|OK with SEDS site|

|Other Information|2002-09-25|1. Previously had info: “This planetary’s age of 48,000 years makes it about 2.5 times older than the average age (20,000 years) of typical bright planetary nebulae.”  – BUT all found info says age only 3-4000 years<br/>2. Previously, had info: “The central star may be a double star with a separation of 1.6 trillion miles (.28 light years or 18,000 times the Earth-sun distance).”  – BUT can only find that “it probably has a faint (mag 27) yellow companion at 6.5" in position angle214 deg (Burnham).” on the SEDS site</br>3.
