WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 40mm or 80 mm.

2.	Through the telescope the cluster will appear as a group of individual stars; much like sugar or salt sprinkled on a table top.
   
3.	This cluster contains a small planetary nebula (NGC 2438) which can be seen through the telescope.



M46 INFORMATION:

1.	This cluster was discovered by Charles Messier in 1771.

2.	The average distance between stars in this cluster is 1.6 light years.
   
3.	This cluster contains a small planetary nebula (NGC 2438) which can be seen through the telescope.  This nebula is not part of M46: it is about 3,000 l.y. away, and so it is between us and the cluster.
