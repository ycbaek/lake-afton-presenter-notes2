WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 40mm or 80 mm.

2.	Through the telescope the cluster will appear as a group of individual stars.



NGC 6530 INFORMATION:

1.	This cluster was first discovered by Giovanni Batista Hodierna before 1654.  It was independently found by John Flamsteed in 1680.

2.	This is a very young group of stars - only a few million years old.
   
3.	These stars formed from a portion of the Lagoon nebula.  The cluster is just in front of the nebula.

Coordinates

tweaked a bit

Magnitude	
01-05-03	
previously: 6.3  – BUT can find no info to support this, can only find 4.6 (on SEDs and other sites)

Distance	
01-05-03	
previously 5,150 ly – BUT rounded up with http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/n6530.html

Actual Brightness

Number of Stars	
01-05-03	
previously 25 – BUT http://www.seds.org/messier/xtra/ngc/n6530.html  says 50 - 100

Diameter	
01-05-03	
previously said 115 ly. – BUT for Lagoon Nebula, SEDs site gave 90x40 arcmin, corresponding to 140x60 ly if distance of 5,200 ly is correct.  Using this conversion, and holding distance to be same for cluster, SEDs gives 14 arcmin for NGC 6530, which corresponds to 21 ly.

Age
