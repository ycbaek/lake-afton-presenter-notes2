#### What To Look For Through The Telescope
---

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 40mm or 80 mm.

2.	Through the large telescope only one of the clusters can be seen at a time.  It will appear as a group of individual stars; much like sugar or salt sprinkled on a table top.

---
## h and χ Persei Information
---

1.	This cluster is bright enough to be seen from a dark location even without binoculars.

    a.	h and χ Persei were probably seen in pre-historic times.

    b.	This object was catalogued by the Greek astronomer Hipparcos (190-120 B.C.).

2.	The two clusters are several hundred light years apart, they just happen to be in the same direction when seen from Earth.
 
3.  h Persei

    a.	about 7,100 light years away

    b.	about 5.6 million years old

    c.	is approaching us at about 22 kilometers/second (13.6 miles/second)

    d.	Has a total mass of about 3700 of our suns.

4.	χ Persei

    a.	about 7,400 light years distant.

    b.	about 3.2 million years old

    c.	is approaching us at about 21 kilometers/second (13 miles/second)

    d.	Has a total mass of about 2800 suns.
