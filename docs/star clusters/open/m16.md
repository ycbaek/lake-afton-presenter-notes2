WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 40mm or 80 mm.

2.	Through the telescope the cluster will appear as a group of individual stars.

3.	Some nebulosity, and perhaps dark pillars, may also be seen.



M 16 INFORMATION:

1.	Some stars in this cluster may have started to shine no more than 50,000 years ago.
   
2.	Other stars have not reached the main sequence yet.  These stars are not yet middle-aged.
   
3.	Although it cannot be seen through the telescope, the northwestern portion of the cluster still has a portion of a diffuse nebula.

 
a.	This nebula is called the Eagle Nebula, and was discovered by Charles Messier in 1764.

b.	In pictures of the Eagle Nebula, EGGs can be seen: Evaporating Gaseous Globules.  These EGGs are new stars still enveloped by the gas and dust from which they’re forming.

4.	The star cluster was discovered in 1745-6 by Philippe Loys de Chéseaux.  Charles Messier independently discovered it in 1764, and at the same time mentioned the faint glow of the nebula.
