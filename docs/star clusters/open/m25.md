WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 40mm or 80 mm.

2.	Through the telescope the cluster will appear as a group of individual stars.



M 25 INFORMATION:

1.	The most luminous stars in this cluster are of spectral type B4.
   
2.	It also has about 50 stars which are brighter than 12th magnitude.
   
3.	These stars formed from a portion of the Lagoon Nebulae.

4.	This cluster was discovered in 1745-6 by Philippe Loys de Chéseaux.

5.	This cluster contains a Cepheid variable star.  

a.	A Cepheid star varies in brightness over a period of days.

 
b.	The amount of change of brightness and the period are directly related, and can be used to find a fairly accurate distance to the star.

c.	If a Cepheid is found in a cluster or a galaxy, the distance to that cluster or galaxy can be determined.
