#### What To Look For Through The Telescope
---

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 40mm or 80 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see a fuzzy patch of light.  This is the galaxy.  If they are having trouble seeing it, have them look at a star near the edge of the field, then look back to the center out of the corner of their eye.
   
3.	The view through the telescope will not look like photographs of galaxies they may have seen.  A photograph of a galaxy may have an exposure of many hours.  This long exposure brings out the galaxy’s details.  Our eyes allow light to collect for only about 1/30 of a second before they refresh themselves and start over again.

## M85 Information
---

1.	M85 is actually a lenticular galaxy, not an elliptical galaxy.  Lenticular galaxies are very easy to mistake for an elliptical galaxy, especially if the lenticular is somewhat face-on. 

2.	M85 is the most northern member of the Virgo cluster of galaxies, and so it actually is in the constellation Coma Berenices.
