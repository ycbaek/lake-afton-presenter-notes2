#### What To Look For Through The Telescope
---

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 40mm or 80 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see a patch of fuzzy light.  This is the galaxy.  If they are having trouble seeing it, have them look at a star near the edge of the field and then look back to the center out of the corner of their eye.
   
3.	The view through the telescope will not look like photographs they may have seen.  A photograph of a galaxy may have an exposure of many hours.  This long exposure brings out spiral arms and other details.  Our eyes allow the light to collect for only about 1/30 of a second before they refresh themselves and start over again.

## M65 Information
---

1.	This galaxy was discovered in 1780 by Pierre Méchain.  However, Charles Messier  didn’t acknowledge his friend’s prior discovery, unlike for most of Méchain’s findings.  Messier catalogued it on March 1, 1780.

2.	Three galaxies – M65, M66, and NGC 3628 – are all about 35 million light years away.  Together, they are called the Leo Triplett.

|Coordinates|2003-01-15|tweaked a bit with SIMBAD: <http://simbad.u-strasbg.fr/simbad/sim-basic?Ident=M65&submit=SIMBAD+search> and SEDs: <http://messier.seds.org/m/m065.html>|
|Distance|2003-01-15|previously: 29-38 million ly – BUT this OK with SEDs <http://messier.seds.org/m/m065.html>|
|Actual Brightness|2003-01-15|can find no support, but looks OK|
|Diameter|2003-01-15|previously said 60 thousand ly – BUT can find no support, but SEDs site says M66 is “considerably lager” than M65... leaving it like this, OK for now|
|Mass|--|  |
|Galactic Type|2003-01-15|previously: Sb – BUT this OK with SEDs|
|Other Information|2003-01-15|previously: “M65 and M66 are about 180,000 light years away from each other.” – BUT, found do direct support, so summarized and added PLEASE NOTE at several places they really DO spell it “Triplett,” instead of “Triplet.”|
