WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope a bright red or reddish-orange point of light should be seen.


μ CEPHEI INFORMATION:

1.	This star is huge: if it were placed at our sun’s position, it would extend beyond the orbit of Saturn!  (Saturn is ~10 AU from the sun)

2.	Like many other red giant stars, this is a variable star: its magnitude varies from 3.4 to 5.1.  The period of the variation ranges between 730 and 4400 days.
 

3.	This star looks very red through the telescope.  Sir William Herschel who discovered the planet Uranus) noticed this deep color, and it is often referred to as “Herschel’s Garnet Star.”
