WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope a bright reddish-orange point of light should be seen.


ANTARES INFORMATION:

1.	Antares is the 11th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night sky (16th brightest if including the Southern Hemisphere’s nighttime stars.
   
2.	This is probably the second largest of the bright stars in the sky.  (Betelgeuse is larger).
   
 
3.	Antares has a companion:

a.	Magnitude: 6.5

b.	Luminosity: 50 times that of the sun.

c.	Spectral Type: B2.5

d.	Separation: 45 billion miles (500 times Earth-Sun distance)

e.	Period: 853 years

Notes

Coordinates	
01-06-2003	
tweaked a bit

Magnitude	
01-06-2003


05-19-2005	
previously: 0.92 – BUT this matches with Scott’s The Flamsteed Collection and SIMBAD
Crosschecked. studies vary from +0.92 to 1.1 so number OK.

Distance	
01-06-2003

05-19-2005	
previously: 520 – BUT this matches with Flamsteed and SIMBAD
OK. Croschecked with paper  Krudrizki &Reimers, 1978, Astron. And Astrophys. Vol 70 p.227
Their numbers: 180 pc, SIMBAD -185 pc

Actual Brightness	
01-06-2003	
previously 9,000 – BUT this matches with Flamsteed

Surface Temperature	
01-06-2003


05-19-2005	
supported by http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/projects/sow/antares.html
Croschecked with paper  Krudrizki &Reimers, 1978, Astron. And Astrophys. Vol 70 p. 227.  They have 3,550k which comes out to 5,900F

Diameter	
01-06-2003	
previously 600 million miles / 700 times sun – BUT site says over 4 AU’s http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/projects/sow/antares.html

Changed from 740 million miles and 860 Suns.  No book or net source agrees with this high number.
Croschecked with paper  Krudrizki &Reimers, 1978, Astron. And Astrophys. Vol 70 p. 227.  They have 575times the Radius of the Sun.

Mass	
01-06-2003

05-19-2005	
10-15 -cannot find support for this, but looks ok?
Croschecked with paper  Krudrizki &Reimers, 1978, Astron. And Astrophys. Vol 70 p. 227.  They have 18 solar masses. So I compromised.
