WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope a bright reddish-orange point of light should be seen.


BETELGEUSE INFORMATION:

1.	Betelgeuse is the 7th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night sky (9th brightest if including the Southern Hemisphere’s bright stars).
   
2.	An irregularly pulsating red supergiant – its diameter may vary as much as 60% during the whole cycle.

 
3.	Note the size of this star: if Betelgeuse were placed in our solar system at our sun’s position, Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and maybe even Jupiter would be inside Betelgeuse!

4.	This is the biggest star seen from Earth, and probably one of the biggest anywhere.

Notes

Coordinates	
01-06-2003	
tweaked a bit

Magnitude	
01-06-2003	
previously 0.70 – BUT SIMBAD says 0.58, and Flamsteed says 0.45

Distance	
01-06-2003	
previously 520 – BUT now OK with Scott’s The Flamsteed Collection and SIMBAD

Actual Brightness	
01-06-2003	
previously 14,000 – BUT now OK with Flamsteed

Surface Temperature	
01-06-2003	
can’t find direct support, but OK with numbers given in Flamsteed

Diameter	
01-06-2003	
previously:480-800 million miles / 550-920 times sun – BUT think it’s safe to say over 800 million - beyond Jupiter’s orbit - like said in http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/apod/ap970216.html

Mass	
01-06-2003	
can find no support, but sounds good
