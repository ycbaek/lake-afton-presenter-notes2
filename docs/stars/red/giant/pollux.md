WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope a bright reddish point of light should be seen.


POLLUX INFORMATION:

1.	Pollux is the 12th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night sky (17th brightest if including the Southern Hemisphere’s bright stars).
   
2.	It is actually brighter than Castor, known as alpha Geminorum.  This breaks from the tradition of using “alpha” to refer to the brightest star in the constellation.
 
3.	In June, 2006, astronomers confirmed the presence of a Jupiter-class planet around Pollux, that was first detected in 1993.  It is Beta Geminorum b.

a.	The planet has a minimum mass of 2.3 Jupiter-masses and maybe up to 2.9 masses.
b.	It moves around Pollux at an average distance of 1.64 AUs  (11 percent farther than Mars is from the Sun), and takes 1.6 years to orbit.



4.	In Greek mythology, Castor and Gemini were twin warriors.  Pollux was fathered by Zeus and was therefore divine, while Castor was mortal.  They were placed in the sky to allow them to be together for all time.

Notes

Coordinates	
01-07-2003	
tweaked a bit, now OK with Scott’s The Flamsteed Collection and SIMBAD

Magnitude	
01-07-2003	
OK with Flamsteed and SIMBAD

Distance	
01-07-2003	
OK with Flamsteed and SIMBAD

Actual Brightness	
01-07-2003	
previously said 35 – but with Flamsteed more like 29

Surface Temperature	
01-07-2003	
with range given in Flamsteed for K stars: 3500-4900 K... pollux is K0, so upper end of range

Diameter	
01-07-2003	
previously 3.6 million miles / 4-5 times Sun – but this says can calculate 11 times sun, measure angular diameter and 8.3 times sun  http://www.astro.uiuc.edu/~kaler/sow/pollux.html
