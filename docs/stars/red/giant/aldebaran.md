WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope a bright reddish-orange point of light should be seen.


ALDEBARAN INFORMATION:

1.	Aldebaran is the 9th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night sky (14th brightest star when including the Southern Hemisphere’s bright stars).
   
2.	This star is the eye of constellation Taurus the Bull.
   
 
3.	Aldebaran may have a companion 1.35 AU’s away, as massive as 11 Jupiters.  This has yet to be confirmed.  (1 AU, or Astronomical Unit, is 93 million miles, the distance between the Sun and Earth.)

Notes

Coordinates	
01-06-2003	
tweaked a bit

Distance	
01-06-2003	
OK with Scott’s The Flamsteed Collection and SIMBAD

Actual Brightness	
01-06-2003	
previously “125"  – BUT Flamsteed says 141

Surface Temperature	
01-06-2003	
previously “5,600 ºF” – BUT 
     Source says 4000 K (~6,700 ºF) http://www.eso.org/outreach/eduoff/catchastar/cas projects/uk_aldebaran_1/
     At anyrate, 5,600 ºF is too cool, according to Flamsteed: K stars lowest temp is 5,800 ºF

Diameter	
01-06-2003






06-02-2005	
previously said 32 millions miles / 40 times bigger than sun – BUT can find not support, plus, at 140 times more luminous, roughly same temp, should radius only be sqrt(140) times bigger plus more for being cooler? 

Paper from Astron. & Astrophys. collated all the anglular measurements and got an average value of 19.96milliarcsec for the uniform disk diameter and 20.58 millarcsec for limb darkened value.  This gives a diameter of 44Rsun with an error of 0.9Rsun.

Density	
01-06-2003	
previously said 0.00005 times Sun – BUT can find no evidence for this

Other Information	
01-06-2003	
previously: “There is a red dwarf companion star 60 billion miles away, or about 650 times the Earth-Sun distance.” – BUT cannot find info that there IS a companion, but that there might be one, see
http://www.extrasolar.net/mainframes.html
