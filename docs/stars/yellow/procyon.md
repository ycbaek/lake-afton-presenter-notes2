WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see a faint star.  It may appear to be a pale yellow.


PROCYON INFORMATION:

1.	Procyon is the 6th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night sky (the 8th brightest star overall).

2.	The Greek name means “before the dog,” referring to the fact that for Northern latitudes, Procyon rises before the “Dog Star,” Sirius.

 
3.	Just because a star is bright doesn’t mean it’s close to us.

a.	The 5th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere is Rigel in the constellation Orion.  Rigel is a very hot, very large, blue star.  It’s brighter than Procyon – but it’s about 770 light years away!

b.	Procyon isn’t quite as bright as Rigel, yet it’s only 11 light years away.  However, Procyon is a medium temperature, medium size, yellow star.

4.	Procyon has a companion star, Procyon B.

a.	Procyon B is a white dwarf.

b.	It was truly discovered in 1895.

c.	However, its existence was known since 1844: Procyon A wobbles a bit, leading astronomers to infer the presence of a companion which could gravitationally influence Procyon A’s motion.
