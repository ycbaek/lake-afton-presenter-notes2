WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see two stars next to each other.  One star should be slightly brighter than the other.

3.	*** INCLUDE THIS? *** Both stars have dimmer companion stars.  They may be seen.


BETA SCORPII INFORMATION:

1.	The brighter star, Star A, is actually a multiple star.

 
a.	However, we can’t see its companion: Star A is a “spectroscopic binary,” which means its companion is detected by looking at a spectra of Star A.

b.	This companion is so close to Star A, they orbit each other in just under 7 days.  This means they’re closer than Mercury is to our Sun.

2.	The dimmer star, Star B, may also be part of a multiple system.

3.	Through the telescope, dim stars can be seen close to both Stars A and B.  It is unclear whether these stars form multiple systems with A and B, or if they are also optical doubles.








In here previously, but cannot be – this is an optical double, not a multiple:

1.	This is actually a 5-member system.  A third star has a magnitude of 9.5 and a period of about 1,000 years.
