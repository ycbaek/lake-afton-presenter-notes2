WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see two stars next to each other.  One star should be slightly brighter than the other.


ALPHA CAPRICORNI INFORMATION:

1.	This star is also called Algedi, from the Arabic meaning “the kid” (a young goat) and it refers to the whole constellation of Capricorn.

2.	Since both stars can be seen with the unaided eye, it is unclear whether “Algedi” refers to both stars, or just the brightest star.
 

3.	Note that despite their similar magnitude, one is much farther – and much more luminous – than the other.

4.	Though most stars with the name “alpha” are the brightest star in their constellation, with the combined magnitude of the two stars, Alpha Capricorni is actually the third brightest star in Capricorn (delta capricorni is the brightest).  It could be named “alpha” because of its position in the constellation, resulting in it being the first star named.

5.	****INCLUDE THIS?***** Through a telescope, both components of Alpha Capricorni have faint companions.  Plus, SIMBAD says both stars are a “star in double system.”  It is unclear whether the components and their companions form optical doubles or multiple stars.
