WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see two stars near each other.  One star should be slightly brighter than the other.  Each star should look slightly oval shaped.

3.	With good atmosphere conditions and/or with good eyes, it can be seen that each star is really two stars.


 
EPSILON LYRAE INFORMATION:

1.	This is the famous “Double Double” star.  (With our understanding of distances and multiple stars, a more accurate name would be the “Double Multiple.”)

2.	The surface composition of these stars, by mass, is 70% hydrogen, 28% helium, and 2% everything else.  (The composition of the stars’ cores depend on what stage of life they’re in.)

OK for all stars... it wouldn’t fit in chart, so had to put it in “other information”
