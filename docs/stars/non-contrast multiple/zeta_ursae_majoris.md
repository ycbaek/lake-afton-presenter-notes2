WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see two stars next to each other.  One star should be slightly brighter than the other.
   
3.	The two stars they see are both called Mizar.  Alcor can be seen in the finder some distance from Mizar.

MIZAR INFORMATION:
 
1.	Mizar is the middle star in the handle of the Big Dipper.

2.	Mizar was the first multiple star discovered.  In the early 1600s, a friend of Galileo’s discovered that it was really two stars.

3.	Each one of the two visible stars in Mizar is actually a multiple star itself!

a.	The two stars are spectroscopic multiples, meaning that their companions can’t be seen, only detected through spectroscopic analysis.

b.	The brighter star is really two stars so close to each other, they only take about 20 days to orbit each other.

c.	The fainter star is really – at least – two stars.

4.	Another star is near Mizar called Alcor.  Alcor can even be seen with the unaided eye on a clear, dark night.

a.	Alcor is three light years from Mizar, so Mizar and Alcor are not part of the same system.  However, Alcor is part of the Ursa Majoris group.

b.	Alcor has a total brightness 12 times that of the sun, is magnitude 3.99, and is spectral type A5V.





FOR GREG: Here’s the “old” stuff – is Mizar quadruple or quintuple?

1.	This is the middle star in the handle of the big dipper.
   
   2a.  The brighter of the visual is itself a double star; although the two stars are too close            to each other to be seen seperatley.

   2b.  Other information for the primary pair: Actual brightness: each 35 times the sun’s             brightness; separation: 18 million miles.

   3.  The fainter of the visual pair is a triple star system.  Periods of 182 days and 1350           days.

   4a.  Alcor is at least three light years away from Mizar.  Although it is not a member           of the Mizar system, it is part of the Ursa Majoris group.

   4b.  Alcor has a total brightness 15 times that of the sun and is itself a double star.
