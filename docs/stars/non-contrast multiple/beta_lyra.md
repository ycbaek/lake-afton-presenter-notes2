WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see two stars next to each other.  In this case the two stars should be about the same brightness.



BETA LYRA INFORMATION:

 
1.	It’s uncertain whether the two stars we see are a multiple system or an optical double.

2.	The primary star is an eclipsing binary star.
a.	Because of the unseen companion that passes in front, the brightness of the primary can change almost a magnitude every 12 days 22 hours.

b.	The primary and its companion are so close they orbit each other in about 13 days.

c.	They’re so close that their atmospheres are intermingling: the primary is losing matter to the unseen companion.

3.	The companion star is also a multiple star.  It is a spectroscopic binary.









FOR GREG
Here’s what the pages said before I researched Beta Lyra a bit.  


   1a.  The primary star is itself a binary star.  The two stars are large enough (15 ans 12        million miles across) ans so close to each other (22 million miles) that their             atmospheres are intermingling.

   1b.  The larger star has the smaller mass - 11 times the sun’s amss, while the smaller             star has the larger mass - 20 times that of the sun.  The reason for this is unknown.
   2.  The secondary star also has a very faint companion that can only be detected with          a spectroscope.

   3.  There is a 5th member to the system that is 9th magnitude.
