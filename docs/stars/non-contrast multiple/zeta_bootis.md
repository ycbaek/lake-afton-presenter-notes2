WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see two stars next to each other.  One star should be slightly brighter than the other.


ZETA BOÖTIS INFORMATION:

1.	The orbits of these stars could set a record: the orbits are very elongated.
 

a.	At their farthest, the stars are about 60 AU’s apart; at their closest, they’re about 1.5 AU’s apart, about as close as Mars to the Sun.

b.	At close passage, the individual stars cannot be resolved – that happened last in 1897, and will happen again in 2021.

c.	At their farthest separation, they can be resolved – the best view will be in 2082.

2.	This large eccentricity could be the result of a violent encounter with another star, but it’s impossible to know.

updated with SIMBAD

Combined Magnitude	
11-08-2002	
previously: 4.60 – now matches Scott’s The Flamsteed Collection

Apparent Separation	
11-08-2002	
previously: 7" – NO idea where that came from: coordinates are identical in RA, DEC is only different 1"

Distance	
11-08-2002	
previously: 88 ly – BUT Flamsteed and SIMBAD say otherwise

Separation
