WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:
1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see three stars in a curved line.  The stars should be about the same brightness.

BETA MONOCEROTIS INFORMATION:
1.	Beta Mon is a triple star system in the constellation  of Monoceros (The Unicorn). 

2.	To the naked eye, it appears as a single star with an apparent visual magnitude of approximately 3.74, making it the brightest visible star in the constellation.

3.	A telescope shows a curved line of three pale blue stars (or pale yellow stars, depending on the scope's focus). 

4.	William Herschel who discovered it in 1781 commented that it is "one of the most beautiful sights in the heavens". 

5.	The star system consists of three Be stars (West to East), β Monocerotis A, β Monocerotis B, and β Monocerotis C.

6.	B and C mostly likely orbit each other, while A orbits the pair. 

7.	There is also an additional visual companion star (~Mag 12) that is probably not physically close to the other three stars
