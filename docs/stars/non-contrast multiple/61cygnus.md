WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see two stars next to each other.  In this case the two stars should be about the same brightness.


61 CYGNI INFORMATION:

1.	Both of these stars are smaller and fainter than the sun.
 

2.	This object was the first star to have its parallax measured.  This was done in 1838  by German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel.

3.	Because the stars are so far apart, they take many years to orbit each other – perhaps as many as 700 years.
