WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope a bright bluish point of light should be seen.


SIRIUS INFORMATION:

1.	Sirius is the brightest star in the night-time sky (considering bright stars in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere).

2.	Sirius is the 6th nearest known star.
   
 
3.	Sirius also has a white dwarf companion.


Period:	
50 years

Separation	
highly elliptical orbit, so separation varies between ~744 million miles to ~2.88 billion miles (~8 to  ~31 times the Earth-Sun distance)

Mass:	
~equal to sun

Diameter:	
7,300 miles

Density:	
~90,000 times the sun’s density (125,000 times that of water or 2.25 tons/in3)

Luminosity:	
~1/400 of the sun’s 

Temperature: 	
44,500 ºF  (25,000K)

Spectral Type:	
 A2-5 VII


4.	Over many, many years, the motion of Sirius through the sky can be detected.  In 1718, Sir Edmund Halley was the first to reveal that stars were not permanent fixtures in the sky by detecting the motion of Sirius.
