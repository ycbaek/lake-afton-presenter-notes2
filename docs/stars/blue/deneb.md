WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope a bright bluish point of light should be seen.


DENEB INFORMATION:

1.	Deneb is the 14th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night sky (19th brightest in the night sky when including Southern Hemisphere’s bright stars).

2.	Deneb radiates nearly 80,000 times as much energy as our sun does!  Yet because it is so very far away, it’s not very bright in the sky.
