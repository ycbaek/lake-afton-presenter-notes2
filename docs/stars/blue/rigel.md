WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope a bright bluish point of light should be seen.


RIGEL INFORMATION:

1.	Rigel is the brightest star in the constellation Orion, and the 5th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night sky (7th brightest in the night sky when including the Southern Hemisphere’s bright stars).
   
 
2.	It must be a very young star since at its present rate of fuel consumption, it cannot last for more than a few million years.

3.	Rigel is apparently a multiple star system.

a.	Rigel’s companion is spectral type B9

b.	This companion is magnitude 7, and can be resolved in medium sized
   		telescopes.

c.	This companion is a spectroscopic binary.

1.   previous density: 0.0004  – BUT
      how know that?
2.   previously: “3a.  Rigel has a
      companion: Magnitude: 6.7
      Separation: more than 250 billion
      miles (2,600 times Earth-Sun
      distance)       3b.  The companion is
      also a binary star with a period of
      9.86 days and a combined          
      luminosity of 150 times that of the
      sun.”   
          – BUT all I can find is what’s
      now in the text.   Some of the info is
      from   http://www.seds.org/Maps/St
      ars_en/Fig/orion.html 
3.   with Hipparcos, these brightness
      “ranks”
