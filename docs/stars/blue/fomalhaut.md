WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope a bright bluish point of light should be seen.


FOMALHAUT INFORMATION:

1.	Fomalhaut is the 13th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night sky (18th brightest in the night sky when including Southern Hemisphere’s bright stars).

2.	Fomalhaut is surrounded by a circumstellar dust disk, shaped like a doughnut.
 

a.	The “outside” of the doughnut extends about 140 A.U. from Fomalhaut.  By comparison, the planet Pluto is about 40 A.U. from our Sun.

b.	The “inside” of the doughnut might have been carved out by a planet.

1.   previously: “2a.  It also apparently
         has a red dwarf companion.
   	Spectral Type: K5
Luminosity: 10% of the sun’s
        luminosity
Separation: ~1 light year
         2b.   This may not be a
         gravitationally bound pair.”
     BUT I can’t find any evidence of
          this companion.
2.   added info about circumstellar disk
3.   with Hipparcos, brightness “rank”
