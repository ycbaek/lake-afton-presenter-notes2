WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope, two bright bluish points of light should be seen.  A third faint star may also be seen.


CASTOR INFORMATION:

1.	Castor is the 17th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night sky (24th brightest in the night sky when including Southern Hemisphere’s bright stars).

2.	Through a telescope, it can be seen that Castor is more than one star.

 
a.	The two bright stars (mag. 2.0 and 2.8) form a multilple star system.

i.	They are separated by about 107 AU (Pluto’s distance from our sun is 40 AU).

ii.	This was the first real multiple star to be recognized.  (Accounts differ as to who realized it first.  Either Reverend John Michell realized it in 1767, or Sir William Herschel realized it and announced it in 1803.)

b.	A faint third star may be seen (mag. 9.0).  It doesn’t seem to be physically associated with the two bright stars.

3.	Each of the three stars are themselves spectroscopic binaries!

a.	Star A is really two almost identical stars which take about 9 days to orbit each other.

b.	Star B is really two stars which only take 3 days to orbit each other.

c.	Star C is really two, much cooler and lower mass stars (M1), which take a mere 20 hours to orbit each other.

4.	In ancient Greece, sailors looked to the twins Castor and Pollux for protection against the dangers of being at sea.
