WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope a bright bluish point of light should be seen.


REGULUS INFORMATION:

1.	Regulus is the 15th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night sky (22nd brightest in night sky when including Southern Hemisphere’s bright stars).

 
2.	Regulus is actually larger – and therefore puts off more light – than Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky.  However, Sirius is brighter in the sky because it’s closer: Sirius is only 8.6 light years away.

1.   previous mass listing: 5 times our
      Sun – BUT could find no evidence
2.   previous gravity: 15.5 times our Sun
      – BUT could find no evidence
3.   previously: “2a. Has a companion
          star 440 billion miles away, or
          about 4,600 Earth-Sun distance
          (177").
          2b. Companion’s brightness: .5
          Sun’s brightness (or 1/300
          Regulus’ brightness)”  – BUT
      could find no evidence
4.   previous density: 0.04  – BUT how
      know this?
5.   previous: 21st brightest star – BUT
      with Hipparcos, these ‘ranks”
