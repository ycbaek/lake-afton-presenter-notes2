WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope a bright bluish point of light should be seen.


ALTAIR INFORMATION:

1.	Altair is the 8th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night-time sky (12th brightest in night sky when including Southern Hemisphere’s bright stars).

2.	Altair rotates on its axis very quickly.

 
a.	Altair takes just 10-1/2 hours to rotate.  Our smaller sun takes thirty days.

b.	Since the star is gaseous, and because it spins so fast, Altair is a bit squashed: Altair’s equatorial diameter is about 14% larger than its polar diameter.

c.	By comparison, Jupiter is also gaseous and slightly squashed, but its equatorial diameter is only about 3% larger than its polar diameter.

1.   previously: “Altair rotates on its axis in
      just 6 ½ hours.  The rotational speed
      at its equator is 160 meters/second. 
      As a result, the equatorial diameter is
      nearly twice the polar diameter.”
      – BUT these speeds are debated:
     118 mi/sec to 155 mi/sec.  Also, Altair
      is flattened, but not nearly that much. 
      See ApJ,559:1155-1164, 2001 Oct. 1
         Web search indicated equatorial
      diameter only 14% larger, and spin is
     10.4 hours.  One site with this info is:

      1/release_2001_150.html 
2.   previously: 15th brightest  – BUT with
      Hipparcos, these brightness “ranks”
