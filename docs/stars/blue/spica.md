WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope a bright bluish point of light should be seen.


SPICA INFORMATION:

1.	Spica is the 10th brightest star in the Northern Hemisphere’s night sky (15th brightest when including bright stars in the Southern Hemisphere).

2.	Spica is an eclipsing binary star.

 
a.	Spica’s companion is spectral type B2V.

b.	The two stars orbit so closely they almost touch.

c.	The two stars are so close they only take four days to complete an orbit.
