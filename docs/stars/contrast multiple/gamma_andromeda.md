WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see two stars next to each other.  The brighter star should appear yellow and the dimmer star blue.


GAMMA ANDROMEDAE INFORMATION:

1.	This star is actually a quadruple star system.

a.	Star A is the yellow star (K3IIb).

b.	Star B is the blue star (B9V), and orbits Star A.  Star B is about 60 billion miles from Star A (600 Earth/Sun).

c.	Star B is actually triple star system.
 

i.	Star C  (A0V)  orbits Star B, and is about 3 billion miles from Star B (the distance from Sun to Neptune).  B and C take 60 years to orbit each other.

ii.	Star D is only about 1 million miles away from Star B (Earth is 93 million from Sun).  B and D only take about 2.7 days to orbit each other.

iii.	Star D is so close to Star B they almost touch.


iv.	Star D can’t be seen, but it does make a wobble in the movement of Star B around Star A.

2.	Note that the colors of these stars may be more striking if they are slightly out of focus.
