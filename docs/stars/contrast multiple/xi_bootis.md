WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.
 

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see two stars ve next to each other.  One star should appear yellow-orange and the other star pinkish-white.


XI BOOTIS  INFORMATION:

1.	The 2 stars are an average of 33.6 AU apart (That’s just a little closer than the distance to Pluto).

2.	They are calculated to get as close as 16.5 AU and as far as 50.7 AU apart.

3.	There may be a third companion orbiting Xi Bootis B that is too dim to see, but detectable by the wobble it causes on the other 2 stars.  One scientist suggests the unknown is about 9 times the mass of Jupiter.  It may be a brown dwarf or a system of planets.

4.	The unknown companion makes Xi Bootis a good prospect in the hunt for planets.
