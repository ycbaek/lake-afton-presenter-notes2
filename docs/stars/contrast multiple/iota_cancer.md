WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see two stars next to each other.  The brighter star should appear yellow and the dimmer star blue.


IOTA CANCRI INFORMATION:

 
1.	The stars are far apart from each other, some 2800 times the distance from the Earth to the Sun.  

2.	A planet near the brighter star would see the fainter star shining as bright as the full Moon does in our sky.  A planet near the fainter star would see the brighter star as 10 times as bright as the full Moon.

3.	With such a large separation, the stars may get ripped away from each other by chance gravitational encounters with passing stars.
