WHAT TO LOOK FOR THROUGH THE TELESCOPE:

1.	Recommended eyepiece: 24mm or 40 mm.

2.	When people look through the telescope they should see two stars next to each other.  The brighter star should appear yellow and the dimmer star blue.


BETA CYGNI INFORMATION:

1.	This star is also known as Albireo.  It is one of the best known contrast optical double stars.
 

2.	The yellow star is actually a multiple star system: the star and an unseen companion orbit each other.

1.   previous:  “About 60 of our solar
        systems could be laid edge to
        edge between these two stars.”
      – BUT much more, so took out.
2.   added info about binary 

found at http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/A/Albireo.html  Other data found using app.mag, dist. and spectral class on a graph of the HR diagram
